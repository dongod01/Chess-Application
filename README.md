# Chess-Application

## Aim of the Project

With the advent of online chess, there are challenges at the top level in the sport. One of the biggest problems faced is "Mouseslips", i.e. making a wrong move accidentally. The intention of starting this project is to minimize such distractions, with the use of button based sound input.

## Salient Features

The application is designed to be played between two players over the internet from any location. One player chooses to be the server, while the other becomes the client. After the connection between the two is established, both players are asked for color preferences, and when opposite colors are chosen, the game begins in a separate window.

The user interface of the game has been designed to precision. All the basic features of online chess are available in-game, such as playing moves, resign, draw, etc. The user can give speech input for each move. All the moves played are displayed as a table. Whenever a game ends, suitable messages are displayed regarding it. Additionally, at the end, a downloadable PGN for the game is available at each players' end in the main window.
